## Introduction
This project emulates the basics of an exchange, allowing users to create their user profile and purchase Bitcoin or 
Ethereum at a given rate, with 10 GBP given at account creation. Users can then allocate a portion of their GBP 
balance to either cryptocurreny and also sell their holdings. The price of the coins fluctuate. After the user is
finished with their account, they can delete it and make another one if they choose.

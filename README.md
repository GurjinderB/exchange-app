## Introduction
This project emulates the basics of an exchange, allowing users to create their user profile and purchase Bitcoin or 
Ethereum at a given rate, with 10 GBP given at account creation. Users can then allocate a portion of their GBP 
balance to either cryptocurreny and also sell their holdings. The price of the coins fluctuate.

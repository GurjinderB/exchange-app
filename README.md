## Introduction
This project emulates the basics of an exchange, allowing users to create their user profile and purchase Bitcoin or 
Ethereum at a given rate, with 10 GBP given at account creation. Users can then allocate a portion of their GBP 
balance to either cryptocurreny and also sell their holdings. The price of the coins fluctuate. After the user is
finished with their account, they can delete it and make another one if they choose.

## Design
The following database was designed to provide the functionality required for the exchange to carry out the basic orders of buying and selling assets.

The future goal of this application would be to retrieve real-time data for each of the cryptocurrencies on offer and to provide a mechanism to transfer holdings to
other users.
